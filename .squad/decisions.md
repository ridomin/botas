# Squad Decisions

## Active Decisions

### 1. Jekyll docs site scaffold (2026-04-12)

**Author:** Kif (DevRel) | **Status:** Implemented

- Created `/docs-site/` with Jekyll + `just-the-docs` remote theme (GitHub Pages compatible).
- Navigation: Home, Getting Started, Languages (with .NET/Node.js/Python children), Middleware, Authentication & Setup.
- Logo copied from `docs/art/icon.svg` to `docs-site/assets/images/logo.svg`.
- All section pages populated with content; nav structure verified.

### 2. User directive: Docs-first feature delivery (2026-04-13)

**Captured by:** Rido (via Copilot) | **Status:** Active

From now on, each feature won't be completed until it has proper docs and samples.

### 3. docs/ folder reorganized to specs/ and art/ (2026-04-13)

**Author:** Kif (DevRel) | **Status:** Implemented

- `docs/specs/` moved to `specs/` at repo root
- `docs/Architecture.md` and `docs/Setup.md` moved to `specs/`
- `docs/art/` moved to `art/` at repo root
- `docs/` directory removed entirely; `docs-site/` remains for the Jekyll site
- All cross-references updated in README.md, AGENTS.md, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, and all three language package READMEs
- Kif's charter and routing.md updated to reflect new paths

**Impact:** Any future references to documentation should use `specs/` (for specs, architecture, setup) and `art/` (for icons/logos). The old `docs/` path no longer exists.

### 3. Middleware Documentation Enhancement (2026-04-13)

**Author:** Kif (DevRel) | **Status:** Completed

Enhanced `docs-site/middleware.md` with:
- Common use cases table (logging, metrics, filtering, auth, rate limiting, context enrichment, error recovery, routing)
- Explanation of activity modification via mutable `context.activity`
- Three language examples of RemoveMentionMiddleware (.NET, Node.js, Python) addressing GitHub Issue #51

Updated `specs/README.md` to link developer guides. All examples follow existing code patterns and require no breaking changes.

**Impact:** Developers can now understand middleware patterns and apply them without reading source code, supporting Decision #2 (docs-first feature delivery).

### 4. RemoveMentionMiddleware Implementation (.NET) (2026-04-13)

**Author:** Amy (.NET Dev) | **Status:** Implemented | **Issue:** #51

- **New `RemoveMentionMiddleware`** (`dotnet/src/Botas/RemoveMentionMiddleware.cs`): Strips @mention text from `activity.Text` when the mention matches the bot's AppId (or falls back to `Recipient.Id`). Case-insensitive matching; trims resulting whitespace.
- **New `BotApp.Use()` method** (`dotnet/src/Botas/BotApp.cs`): Deferred-registration pattern mirrors `BotApp.On()` — middleware registered before handlers.
- **MentionBot sample** (`dotnet/samples/MentionBot/`): Demonstrates middleware registration.
- **10 new tests**: All 27 tests pass.

**Cross-language impact:** Node.js and Python should implement equivalent middleware for parity.

### 5. RemoveMentionMiddleware Implementation (Node.js) (2026-04-13)

**Author:** Fry (Node Dev) | **Status:** Implemented | **Issue:** #51

- **`RemoveMentionMiddleware` class** (`node/packages/botas/src/remove-mention-middleware.ts`): Implements `ITurnMiddleware`; strips bot @mentions from `activity.text` by matching `entity.mentioned.id` against `activity.recipient.id`.
- **Design:** Middleware mutates `activity.text` in-place (shared TurnContext object); only strips bot-self mentions.
- **Exported** from package index.
- **10 new tests**: All 36 tests pass.

### 6. RemoveMentionMiddleware Implementation (Python) (2026-04-13)

**Author:** Hermes (Python Dev) | **Status:** Implemented | **Issue:** #51

- **`RemoveMentionMiddleware`** (`python/packages/botas/src/botas/remove_mention_middleware.py`): Implements `ITurnMiddleware` (Protocol); strips `<at>BotName</at>` text from incoming activities when mention targets the bot.
- **Sample** (`python/samples/echo-bot-no-mention/main.py`): Demonstrates usage.
- **8 new tests** (`python/packages/botas/tests/test_remove_mention_middleware.py`): All 45 tests pass; lint clean (ruff).
- **Pattern:** Iterate entities, match mention type + bot ID, regex-strip mention text.

## Archived Decisions

### Remove createReplyActivity from Internal Spec Files (2025-01-10)

**Author:** Kif (DevRel) | **Status:** Completed

All mentions of `createReplyActivity()` and its language variants removed from docs/bot-spec.md and AGENTS.md. Reply construction logic now documented implicitly through behavioral invariants and sample code.

## Governance

- All meaningful changes require team consensus
- Document architectural decisions here
- Keep history focused on work, decisions focused on direction
