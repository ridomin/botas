# Squad Decisions

## Active Decisions

### 1. Jekyll docs site scaffold (2026-04-12)

**Author:** Kif (DevRel) | **Status:** Implemented

- Created `/docs-site/` with Jekyll + `just-the-docs` remote theme (GitHub Pages compatible).
- Navigation: Home, Getting Started, Languages (with .NET/Node.js/Python children), Middleware, Authentication & Setup.
- Logo copied from `docs/art/icon.svg` to `docs-site/assets/images/logo.svg`.
- All section pages populated with content; nav structure verified.

### 2. User directive: Docs-first feature delivery (2026-04-13)

**Captured by:** Rido (via Copilot) | **Status:** Active

From now on, each feature won't be completed until it has proper docs and samples.

### 3. docs/ folder reorganized to specs/ and art/ (2026-04-13)

**Author:** Kif (DevRel) | **Status:** Implemented

- `docs/specs/` moved to `specs/` at repo root
- `docs/Architecture.md` and `docs/Setup.md` moved to `specs/`
- `docs/art/` moved to `art/` at repo root
- `docs/` directory removed entirely; `docs-site/` remains for the Jekyll site
- All cross-references updated in README.md, AGENTS.md, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, and all three language package READMEs
- Kif's charter and routing.md updated to reflect new paths

**Impact:** Any future references to documentation should use `specs/` (for specs, architecture, setup) and `art/` (for icons/logos). The old `docs/` path no longer exists.

## Archived Decisions

### Remove createReplyActivity from Internal Spec Files (2025-01-10)

**Author:** Kif (DevRel) | **Status:** Completed

All mentions of `createReplyActivity()` and its language variants removed from docs/bot-spec.md and AGENTS.md. Reply construction logic now documented implicitly through behavioral invariants and sample code.

## Governance

- All meaningful changes require team consensus
- Document architectural decisions here
- Keep history focused on work, decisions focused on direction
