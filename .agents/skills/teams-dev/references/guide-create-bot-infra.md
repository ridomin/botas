# Bot Infrastructure Creation Guide

This guide walks through setting up the infrastructure for a Microsoft Teams bot: Teams-managed bot, AAD app creation, credentials, and Teams app manifest. **Note:** This creates a Teams-managed bot, not an Azure Bot Service registration. For SSO, you'll need to migrate to Azure-managed later. This creates the bot identity and authentication, but not the bot application code itself (see the [Bot Application Development guide](guide-create-bot-app.md) for that).

## 1. Prerequisites Verification

Before creating a Teams bot, verify these prerequisites:

### Step 1: Check Teams CLI Installation

Verify the Teams CLI is installed:

```bash
teams --version
```

**Expected output:** Shows version number (e.g., `1.0.0` or similar)

**If not installed:**

Install the Teams CLI using npm:

```bash
npm install -g https://github.com/heyitsaamir/teamscli/releases/latest/download/teamscli.tgz
```

**After installation:**
- Verify: Run `teams --version` to confirm installation
- You should see the version number

**Checkpoint:** Teams CLI is installed.

### Step 2: Check Authentication

Run the following command to check authentication status:

```bash
teams status
```

**Expected output:** Shows authenticated user information.

**If not authenticated:**
1. Run: `teams login`
2. Follow the authentication flow
3. Verify: Run `teams status` again and confirm you see your authenticated account

**Checkpoint:** Authentication verified before proceeding.

### Step 3: Set Up Bot Endpoint

Your bot needs a publicly accessible HTTPS endpoint for Teams to send messages to it.

**Expected format:** `https://your-domain/api/messages`

#### Option A: Use Existing Endpoint

If you already have a deployed bot or public URL, use that endpoint and proceed to the next section.

#### Option B: Set Up Development Tunnel (Persistent)

For local development, create a **persistent tunnel** that keeps the same URL across sessions.

**Install devtunnels (if not already installed):**

See the official guide: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/dev-tunnels/get-started?tabs=windows

**Create a persistent tunnel (one-time setup):**

```bash
devtunnel create my-teams-bot --allow-anonymous
devtunnel port create my-teams-bot -p 3978 --protocol auto
```

Replace `my-teams-bot` with your preferred tunnel name.

**Important:** Port `3978` is the default Teams SDK port. Protocol `auto` allows both HTTP and HTTPS. The `--allow-anonymous` flag allows Teams to connect without authentication.

**Expected output:**
```
Created tunnel: my-teams-bot (<tunnel-id>)
Hosting port: 3978
Tunnel URL: https://<tunnel-id>.devtunnels.ms
```

**Start the tunnel (each development session):**

```bash
devtunnel host my-teams-bot
```

Your persistent tunnel URL remains: `https://<tunnel-id>.devtunnels.ms`

**Format your endpoint URL:**
```
https://<tunnel-id>.devtunnels.ms/api/messages
```

**Alternative:** Use ngrok (`ngrok http 3978`) if you prefer.

**Note:** With a persistent tunnel, your URL stays the same across sessions - you only need to run `devtunnel host my-teams-bot` to start it each time.

**Checkpoint:** Endpoint URL is ready (either existing or persistent tunnel-based).

## 2. Create Teams-Managed Bot

Now create the Teams-managed bot with infrastructure.

### Step 1: Run Creation Command

Execute the following command (replace placeholders):

```bash
teams app create --name "YourBotName" --endpoint "https://your-endpoint/api/messages" --json
```

**Parameters:**
- `--name`: Your bot's display name (e.g., "Notification Bot", "MyBot")
- `--endpoint`: The bot messaging endpoint URL
- `--json`: Output structured JSON (required for parsing)

**Expected:** Command completes successfully and returns JSON output.

### Step 2: Parse JSON Output

The command returns JSON with these fields:

```json
{
  "appName": "YourBotName",
  "teamsAppId": "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
  "botId": "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
  "endpoint": "https://your-endpoint/api/messages",
  "installLink": "https://teams.microsoft.com/l/app/...",
  "botLocation": "teams-managed",
  "credentials": {
    "CLIENT_ID": "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
    "CLIENT_SECRET": "your-secret-value",
    "TENANT_ID": "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Save Credentials to .env File

Ask the user: **"Do you already have a .env file for this project?"**

**If YES:**
- Prompt: "What is the path to your .env file?"
- Default suggestion: `.env` (current directory)
- Example paths: `.env`, `./bot/.env`, `../config/.env`

**If NO:**
- Prompt: "Where should I create the .env file?"
- Default: `.env` (current directory)
- Inform: "I'll create a new .env file at this location"

**After getting the path:**

Write the credentials to the .env file using the values from JSON output:

```
CLIENT_ID=<value-from-json>
CLIENT_SECRET=<value-from-json>
TENANT_ID=<value-from-json>
```

**Instruct the user:**

"Credentials saved to [path]. Your bot application code will use these values to authenticate with Microsoft Teams."

**Important:** If the .env file already exists, replace any existing `CLIENT_ID`, `CLIENT_SECRET`, and `TENANT_ID` entries in place with the new values. Append only the keys that are missing. Do not create duplicate entries for these keys, and do not overwrite any other existing values in the file.

### Step 4: Display Install Link

Show the install link from the JSON output:

```
Install your bot in Teams:
<install-link-from-json>
```

**Instruct the user:**

"Open this link in your browser to install the bot in Microsoft Teams. You can install it for personal use, in a team, or in a group chat."

**Do NOT automatically open the browser** - let the user decide when to install.

**Checkpoint:** Bot created successfully, credentials and install link displayed.

---

## 3. Verification

Verify the bot was created successfully.

### Step 1: Verify App Exists

Run the following command (use the `teamsAppId` from creation output):

```bash
teams app get <teamsAppId> --json
```

**Expected output:** Returns app details matching what was created:
- `teamsAppId` matches
- `botId` matches
- `endpoint` matches (or is empty if not configured)
- App shows as active

**If verification fails:** Check the error message and refer to the [Troubleshooting guide](troubleshooting.md).

**Checkpoint:** App verified in Teams Developer Portal.
